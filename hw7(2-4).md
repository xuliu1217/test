- What is the @Transient, @Temporal, @Enumerated?1. @Transient
  - @Transient annotation is used to mark a field to be transient for the mapping frameworkã€‚ Using @Transient, the field is ignored by mapping framework and will not be mapped to any database column (in RDBMS) or Document property (in NOSQL). Thus the property will not be persisted to data store.
  - @Temporal annotation is used to insert date, time or both in database table.
  - @Enumerated Annotation will map an enum value to and from its database representation in JPA. This way, we can instruct a JPA provider to convert an enum to its ordinal or String value.

- explain how the below annotaitons specify the table in database?
```
@Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(255) default 
'John Snow'")
private String name;
   
@Column(name="STUDENT_NAME", length=50, 
nullable=false, unique=false)
private String studentName;
```
  - The first one: name will be mapping to a column in a table, and the type of the column is varchar(255). If there is no value provided, the default is Jonl Snow.
  - The second one: studentName will be mapping to a column in a table, and the column name is STUDENT_NAME, the maximum length is 50. And the vaule can't be null. Besides, the value can be duplicate.
